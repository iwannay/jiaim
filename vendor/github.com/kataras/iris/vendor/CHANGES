# github.com/kataras/survey

## From the original Alec's repo:

- Misspell and the Transform feature.
- Fix if Confirm and `Validate: survey.Required` is used
and answer is "No" (== false)
then it shows "Sorry, your reply was invalid: Value is required"
and it stucks there.
This happens because 'false' is the zero value of a "bool" type.validation.go#isZero.
- Vendors manually and carefully added.

## From the kataras/survey repo:

- Tests and examples removed.
- Because of test removed, we don't need the stretchr/assert package
which depends on the following;
	- vendor/golang removed.
	- vendor/github.com/davecgh removed.
	- vendor/github.com/pmezard removed.
	- vendor/github.com/stretchr removed.
